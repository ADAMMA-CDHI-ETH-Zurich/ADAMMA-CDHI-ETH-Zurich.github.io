# my-awesome-site

The goal of this project was to develop my own website. It is hosted on the ETH server (url: https://n.ethz.ch/~dfilipe/) 

# Licensing

The website is inspired from themes created by Travis Peters, who made them available under the MIT license (https://github.com/traviswpeters/traviswpeters.github.io).

It is powered by Jekyll & Yeti / Bootstrap, and is hosted and published on the ETH server.

The website theme and template (e.g., CSS file, fonts) are available under the MIT license as in the original work. The rest of the textual content is licensed under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) unless explicitly noted otherwise. Other files (e.g., images, pdfs) might have different ownership and license constraints.
